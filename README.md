# Forecasting French elections with Bayesian Probabilistic Programming
### _Electoral forecasting models for [PollsPosition.com](https://www.pollsposition.com/)_

- You like videos? Well, who doesn't? I'm happy to say it's your lucky day: I just gave a [talk at PyMCon 2020](https://youtu.be/EYdIzSYwbSw), going through and explaining this exact model. So, sit down in your long chair, get the :popcorn:, and enjoy the ride :clapper:

- This repo contains the Bayesian models and data I use to forecast French elections on my website. For now, you'll find here the most recent model -- which is also the most complex and most interesting in my opinion. When I have time I'll try to upload the older models here too -- but I'm doing that on my free time, so please be patient about that. In any case, I'll put future models here, so this repo should be up-to-date with the website going forward.

- Vizualize the plots and results of the model for Paris 2020 city-council elections in an interactive [Voil√†](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) web app by clicking this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlexAndorra/pollsposition_models/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fdistrict-level%2Fmunic_model_analysis.ipynb). Lots of amazing things -- coded by awesome people -- are happening under the hood when you click this button, so there may sometimes be some latency. But I think it will be worth your 10-second wait :partying_face:

You are free to use the models and data uploaded here -- just make sure you properly cite and link to this repository. [Feel free to reach out](https://twitter.com/alex_andorra) for any question, comment or contribution. Best Bayesian wishes :vulcan_salute:
