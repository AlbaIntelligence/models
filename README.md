# Forecasting French elections with Bayesian Probabilistic Programming
### _Electoral forecasting models for [PollsPosition.com](https://www.pollsposition.com/)_

Vizualize the plots and results of the model for Paris 2020 city-coucil elections in an interactive [Voil√†](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) web app by clicking this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlexAndorra/pollsposition_models/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fdistrict-level%2Fmunic_model_analysis.ipynb). Lots of amazing things -- coded by awesome people -- are happening under the hood when you click this button, so there may sometimes be some latency. But I think it will be worth your 10-second wait ;)

This repo contains the (mostly) Bayesian models and data I use to forecast French elections on my website. For now, you'll find here the most recent model -- which is also the most complex and most interesting in my opinion. When I have time I'll try to upload the older models here too -- but I'm doing that on my free time, so please be patient about that. In any case, I'll put future models here, so this repo should be up to date with the website going forward.

You are free to use the models and data uploaded here for non-commercial purposes -- just make sure you properly cite and link to this repository.

Best Bayesian wishes!
